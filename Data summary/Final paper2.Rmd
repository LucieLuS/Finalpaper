Since the 1980s, economic liberalization has advanced remarkably. There has been a marked shift in the orientation of the trade and industrial policies for developing countries. Many developing countries moved away from a heavy reliance on direct intervention and inward-looking trade regimes toward less controlled and more export-oriented trade regimes. Simply put, they chose to liberalize their trade regimes. Many developing countries have decided to integrate their economies into a global economy by dismantling their protectionist trade policies. Countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico have conducted substantial trade reforms respectively, including reducing tariff rates, reforming import licensing procedures in the 1980s. What drove such a substantial change in their trade policy? 



What has driven the trend in trade liberalization? For the developing countries, it is costly for them to abandon the protectionist, import-substituting industrialization strategy given that they have been the orthodoxy among developing country policymakers in the post-war period. A temporary protection for the infant industry is sometimes necessary for infant industries to gain competitiveness in trade in the developing countries. However, over time, many infant industries refuse to mature but become inefficient, and what is worse, they hold vested interests of the oligarchies. In this case, interest groups and political leaders usually benefit from the status quo of the protectionist policies. Change in the protectionist status quo is unexpected. This make the question puzzling. If the political leaders benefit from the status quo, why do they conduct reforms? Why would they choose to lower the trade barriers?


#Argument


Rodrick (1994) argues that it is very difficult for politicians to conduct liberalization reforms in normal times, but times of crises can provide an opportunity moment for undertaking structural reforms. What are the 'times of crises' to drive the structural change? Some scholars claim the economic crises may force countries to give up the protectionist old policies and move toward a market-friendly and open one. Crises may underscore the problems of the old protectionist view of a country, so countries conduct reform and liberalize to recover from the crises (Krugers, 1997). Others claim that external pressure such as a country's accession to the international institutions helps facilitate the transition. External pressures such as the World Trade Organization (WTO), IMF or trade treaties, matter (Vreeland, 2007). When developing countries join these international institutions or sign the binding international trade agreements with other developed countries, the newly joined members will show their commitment to the international regimes (Baccini & Urpelainen, 2014). A voluntary tariff reduction in a developing country will send a promising signal to the international community. 


Now, what about political reforms?  Another closely related structural change, the trend of democratization, was happening a decade before the trend to free trade. In 1975, there were around thirty democracies in the world, while by 1992, there were about eight-nine. Are these two trends causally related or happened to coincide by chance? When countries are more democratized, are they more likely to initiate trade liberalizing economic reforms? Are sharp changes in the economic reform the product of political transformation? As Rodrik argued, "Not all political transformations result in trade reform, but sharp changes in trade policy are typically the result of such transformation (1994, p. 69)." This article largely focuses on the regime type. To show that the regime type places a role in the move to free trade, I will also control for the factors of economic crisis and external pressure illustrated above.  



What remains unclear is whether political reforms affect trade policy reforms, or whether trade reforms induce political transition. The research design of observational data plus classic regression model cannot fully address this endogeneity issue. The fundamental problem of drawing causal inference in an observational data is to make the right comparison. To compare apples to apples, we need to hold other things equal. Because in observational studies, treatments are observed rather than assigned, so it is not possible to consider the observed data under different treatment are randomly assigned. It is highly possible that the two groups of countries (one with democratization, the other without) are fundamentally different in many ways. All of the potential confounders (whether observed or unobserved) will obscure the causal relationship we try to infer. Milner and Kubota's article (2005), "Why the Move to Free Trade? Democracy and Trade Policy in Developing Countries" is a classic piece. They provide a systematic investigation on the relationship between regime change and trade liberalization. They have suggested that democracy has led to trade liberalization. I will cast doubt on their analysis strategy that has relied on controlling for confounding covariates through linear regression. I suggest that a more sophisticated research design, matching can to some extent solve the selection bias problem in the observational data.  


I am going to replicate and extend the paper on Milner and Kubota's argument: When countries become more democratic, they are more willing to open their markets to the international economy. I have a couple of concerns on their original work. They present the average treatment effect of democracy on average tariff level in the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) model, which at best only presents the two variables are positively correlated. Given the limitation of observational data, it is not convincing to draw a causal relationship between the two. To extend their original piece, inspired by Angrist and Pischke (2015), I will conduct a regression with matching approach to overcome the possible selection problem in the observational data. The goal of this replication paper is to present a regression-based causal story: countries that have democratized will tend to lower their levels of trade barriers.  


The paper will be divided into three main sections. The first section will briefly describe the variables, measures, the reasons for adjustment. The second and third section present discussion of two methods of statistical inference and assessment.

#Section I: Data on Trade Liberalization and Democratization

The data that I use in the following analysis is a data set compiled by Milner and Kubota (2005). It is a time-series cross-sectional (TSCS) data, covering 81 developing countries from 1980 to 1999. It include various measures not only on trade policy but also of a series of political regime measures, economic development measures and so on. The central hypothesis is that an increase in democracy will lead to a reduction in trade barriers, ceteris paribus.    


The data Milner and Kubota have collected on the developing countries demonstrate a significant change in the measure of trade policy. *Tariff*, a country's unweighted average statutory tariff rate collected, is a key measure of a country's trade policy in year *t*. The historical trend shows that a dramatic decline in the average tariff level across countries has happened from 1982 to 1999. Statutory tariff rate has decreased by over sixty percent, from an average about 30 percent in 1980 to around 12 percent in 1999 in the developing countries.

```{r, eval=T, echo=F, results="hide"}
#library(readstata13)
mydata <- read.dta13(file.choose())
#View(mydata)
#Subset the large dataset
mydata2 <- mydata[,c(2,3,14,7,15,5,40,17,4,8,10,16), drop=F]


#View(mydata2)
colnames(mydata2) <- c("Country","Year","Tariff","Openness","Regime","Democracy","Dictator","Years of Office","GATT/WTO","Economic Crisis","GDP PC 95","IMF")
mydata_2 <- subset(mydata2, Year > 1979) #Select the years aftr 1979.

save(mydata_2,file="mydata_2fulldataset.rda")

#The change of the statutory tariff rate
m1980 <- mean(mydata2$Tariff[mydata2$Year==1980], na.rm = T)
m1999 <- mean(mydata2$Tariff[mydata2$Year==1999], na.rm = T)
mperc<- (m1999-m1980)/m1980
mperc #-0.58

result_m_tariff <- data.frame(matrix(nrow=20, ncol=2))
colnames(result_m_tariff) <- c ("Year", "Tariff")
for (i in 1:20){
  result_m_tariff[i,1] <- i+1979
  mean <- mean(mydata2$Tariff[mydata_2$Year== i+1979], na.rm = T)
  result_m_tariff[i,2] <- mean
}
result_m_tariff
#plot(result_m_tariff)

```


More evidence of trade liberalization comes from a second measure of trade policy: the dichotomous categorization of countries into open and closed trade regimes. The data covers ninety developing countries from 1980 to 1999. In 1980, only 14 countries were scored as openness, while in 1999, 62 countries were open economies. The number of a country classified as open economy has increased by three times.

```{r, eval=T, echo=F, results="hide"}
o1980 <- sum(mydata2$Openness[mydata2$Year==1980 & mydata2$Openness == 1], na.rm = T) #14
o1999 <- sum(mydata2$Openness[mydata2$Year==1999 & mydata2$Openness == 1], na.rm = T) #62
operc <- (o1999-o1980)/o1980

```

Evidence of democratization among the developing countries is also plentiful. To measure regime type, the paper uses the 21-Point Polity Score, ranging from -10 for a highly autocratic state to 10 for a highly democratic state. The average Polity IV score for about 110 developing countries that fell from around -3.4 to -4.7 and increased sharply to a score of 1.8 in 1999. It suggests that although many regimes on averages with mixes of democratic and autocratic features (-5 to 5), the wave of democratization has been evident since the mid-1970s. Similarly, the dichotomous regime shows how the number of democracies has increased over time. The series show that the process of democratization has started in the 1970s. In 1970, less than 20 developing countries were quantified as democracies. Over three decades, there has been a four-fold increase in the number of democracies among the developing countries.  

```{r, eval=T, echo=F, results="hide"}

result_m_regime_2 <- data.frame(matrix(nrow=30, ncol=2))
colnames(result_m_regime_2) <- c ("Year", "PolityScore")
for (i in 1:30){
  result_m_regime_2[i,1] <- i+1969
  mean <- mean(mydata2$Regime[mydata2$Year== i+1969], na.rm = T)
  result_m_regime_2[i,2] <- mean
}
result_m_regime_2

#plot(result_m_regime_2)

```

```{r, eval=T, echo=F, results="hide"}

result_m_regime_3 <- data.frame(matrix(nrow=30, ncol=2))
colnames(result_m_regime_3) <- c("Year", "Democracy")

for (i in 1:30){
  result_m_regime_3[i,1] <- i+1969
  counter <- sum (mydata2$Democracy[mydata2$Year== i+1969 & mydata2$Democracy ==1], na.rm=T)
  result_m_regime_3[i,2] <- counter
}

#Section II: Empirical analysis: The OLS Models

##Variables and Measures


**Dependent Variables**  
*Tariff* is a country's average statutory tariff rate between 1980 and 1999. However, this is poorly measured with a large number of missing data in the dataset. To be fair, it is notoriously difficult to measure and hard to find time-series and cross-sectional data on this measure.  


**Independent Variable**

*Regime (Polity Score)* is a 21-point scale that measures variations both within democracies and among autocracies. This measurement comes from Polity III and Polity IV. It ranges from -10 (highly autocratic) to 10 (highly democratic). I converted it as a dichotomous variable *Democracy* with countries scoring below 6 in the Polity Score as autocracies (=0) and those above 6 as democracies (=1). The hypothetical treatment here is "*democracy*." 



**Control Variables and Justification**  


*GDP per capita* is a lagged value of per capita real GDP based in 2005. The economic development is likely to affect its trade policy and its political regime change. More developed countries tend to be more economically and politically liberal. More developed countries tend to have smaller trade barriers.  


*Economic Crisis* is an extreme event that occurs in that specific year rather than an economic variable with yearly change. To code that year with the economic crisis, one of the two conditions hold: either the country's inflation rate is 40 percent or more, and it increases by 25 percent or more from the year before, or per capita GDP falls by 15 percent or more from the previous year (=1).     

When countries experience crisis, the political leaders tend to conduct political and economic reforms to address the crisis. They are more likely to liberalize their trade regime because of a domestic demand or conditionality of foreign aid. They will tend to lower the tariff rates to facilitate trade. Under the pressure of economic crisis, politicians are more likely to undergo political reforms as well.   

*GATT/WTO Member* is A lagged variable indicating whether a country is in the GATT/WTO(=1) or not. Joining a WTO induce member countries to lower their trade barriers. Also, WTO members tend to welcome new members intending to adopt liberal policies in both economic and political domains. Therefore, this controlled variable may have effects on both independent and dependent variables.  


*Years of Office* counts the number of years a government has been in office. It ranges from 0 to 44, with the mean of 8.4. It is included in the control variable because the number of years a government in power will have an impact on both political and economic reforms. A new government might indicate a change in leadership and new idea.


The summary of statistics is included in the appendix.

##Data Structure

The correlation coefficient itself is simply a way to describe how the two variables vary together. Here, I first look at the bivariate relationship between the average tariff rate and polity score. The correlation coefficient *r* is -0.12. From Table 2, we can see there are negative relationships between the dependent variable, the independent variable and the control variables (except WTO members). It is noted that the covariate coefficients between the dependent variable, independent variable and cofounders are low. This correlation matrix provides evidence of a low possibility of the collinearity issues in the later regression analysis.  

```{r bivariate relationship, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, results = "hide", message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

plot (mydata2$Regime, mydata2$Tariff, col = "darkblue", pch = 20, xlab = "Regime Type (Polity Score)", ylab = "Tariff Rate (in percentage)",
      main = "Bivariate Relationship bewtween \n Regime Type and Tariff Rate")

OLS_1 <- lm(Tariff ~ Regime, data=mydata2)
abline(OLS_1)

r_tr <- cor(mydata2$Tariff, mydata2$Regime, use = "pairwise.complete.obs")

This figure tells me two important problems of the data structure in this dataset: 1) There are outliers in the data structure that we need to take them into account. Later on, I will use "lmrob" regression modelling strategy to handle unusual observations that do not follow the general trend of the dataset. 2) Variations of tariffs and polity scores across countries and across years are merged. For a single point on the figure, I can get the values of x (polity score) and y (tariff rate) of that point. However, I do not know that particular point stands for which year or/and which country. Before I proceed, I will examine whether variation across countries for a given year (*country differences*) or variation across years within a given country (*year differences*)is higher.

```

I calculated across-country variance (`r countrydiff`) and within-country-years variance (`r yeardiff`). Across-country variance is around 1.7 times of the within-country-years variance. It means that differences across countries are higher than differences across years within each country. I also calculated an ICC score: It is a method of Simple Estimation of the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient. Interclass correlation is the relative values of the country- and year-level variances (Gilman & Hill, p. 258). The variance within countries is quite high with ICC score `r ICC_wc`. In this case, the interclass correlation `r ICC_wc` suggests that differences between across countries convey more information than differences across years within a country. This suggests that within a country, a country's tariff levels have not changed much across years. In contrast, tariffs variations across countries are high. The boxplots further demonstrate this point. 


In the current dataset, the panel dataset includes the yearly tariff data for 81 developing countries over a 20-year period. Tariffs variations across countries are larger than variations across years within a country. Therefore, I collapse the dataset to 81 data points so I can know what the mean tariff rate (and other information) is for each country. Here, the country is the grouping variable. Hence, I reduce the data to the cross-sectional dimension. I run my analysis based on time-series averages. My dependent variable is the time-series mean of tariff rate of the country *i* and my independent variable is the time-series mean of polity score. I also converted the time-series mean of polity score to a dichotomous variable, meaning that a developing country is democratic or non-democratic based on the polity scores on average over the 20-year period.

##Hypothesis and Analysis


I have laid out the reasons to control for the three covariates: GDP per capita, economic crisis and WTO membership. The fourth one, "year of office"" is added for additional check. Only covariates that meet the condition of affecting both the treatment and outcome variables confound the observed relationship between the two (Rubin, 1997; Achen, 1982). I hope that through the control of these relevant covariates, the treatment effect of democratization is less cofounded. I lag all of the independent variables by one year. The basic OLS equation estimating the relationship between democracy and trade policy is:  

$tradepolicy_{i,t} = \beta_0 + \beta_1*Democracy_{i,t-1} + \beta_2*GDPPC_{i,t-1} + \beta_3*ECCRISIS_{i,t-1} + \beta_4*WTO_{i,t-1} + \beta_5*OFFICE_{i,t-1} + \varepsilon_i$  


My main hypothesis is **democratic developing countries are oriented toward lower tariff rates than nondemocratic developing countries.**


I compare democratic developing countries and non-democratic developing countries in this model. The regime type, "democracy" is a hypothetical treatment effect. I concern what would happen to the average tariff rate of a given developing country as a result of a hypothesized "treatment (democracy)" in the observational studies. I understand this is not a randomized experiment at all, and the treatment and control groups in nature are not similar. I hope that I can to some extent address this problem through proper modelling and statistical adjustment.   


Table 2 shows that compared to non-democratic countries, democratic countries on average tend to have lower tariff rates. In all of the regressions, the estimators of *democracy* have expected negative signs that support my main hypothesis. In equation (6), the main model here with three covariates, we know that the average tariff rates fall by 2 percent if a country changes from non-democracy to a democracy.

In regression modelling, *lmrob* is a robust statistics, which could be considered to handle unusual observations and outliers that do not follow the general trend of the data set. 'Robust' means that the tests have good power for a wide variety of distributions even if some of the assumptions used to justify the estimation method are not applicable. The *lmrob* output from the *lmrob* function provides 'robustness weights' to give us information about the outliers in the observations by evaluating their weights and summarize statistics from the remaining observations. It uses a fitting criterion that is not as vulnerable as least squares to unusual data. The estimators in the *lmrob* robust regression are weighted-least-squares estimates.  


In all the models, the estimators' signs are negative, as expected. Compared to the lm models, the magnitudes of the treatment effects are higher. In equation (6), we can see that the average tariff rates fall by 3.5 percent if a country changes from non-democracy to a democracy. The estimators for GDP per capita and economic crisis also have the expected negative signs.

##Check the assumption of linearity

What assumptions do we have about the unmeasured forces influencing the outcome variables? In the linear regression, we assume linearity as a function form of the measured regressors and the dependent variable. However, all it requires is the independent variables should not be *perfectly* collinear (Achen, 1982). According to Achen (1982), if these assumptions are met, the coefficient estimates from the OLS are consistent, meaning they will be very near to their true value in a large sample almost all the time. In other words, in general conditions, regression will produce fairly accurate estimates if we set up the model correctly. Great resilience is a strength of ordinary linear regression (Achen, 1982). That is probably why we should analyze our data with this powerful tool in the first place.  


```{r residual diagnostic plots 1 on non-linearity assumption, eval=T, echo=F, results="asis", message=F} 

#Residual plot

g_re <- ggplot(data.frame(x=mydata_5$Regime_Bi_c, y=resid(OLS_5_1Bs))

OLS_5_1Bsyres <- resid(OLS_5_1Bs)

OLS_5_1yx2res <- resid(lm(Tariff_c ~ log(GDP_c),data=mydata_5))

plot(OLS_5_1x1x2res, OLS_5_1yx2res, frame = FALSE, col = "black", bg = "lightblue", pch = 21, cex = 2, xlim = c(-2, 2), xlab = "residlm(x1~x2)", ylab = "residlm(y~x2)")
abline(lm(I(OLS_5_1x1x2res) ~ I(OLS_5_1yx2res)), lwd = 2)

```

I use the residual plot to check the linearity assumption. Residuals are the vertical distance between the outcomes and the fitted regression line. It is difficult to see its pattern when the independent variable is a binary one. However, linearity is satisfied because the independent variable only has two possibilities (0 or 1). Therefore, the estimator here is the differences of means between the treated and controlled group.     

I am concerned about the partial relationship between tariff rate and democracy score. I am interested in seeing what percent of the variation in the full multiple regression model (Model 2 in Table 2) cannot be explained by the independent variable but can be explained by the rest of the confounders. It is easier to show the partial relationship when I only have one independent variable and one control variable so I can remove one of them at a time. In this plot, I can see by removing one my covariate, "log(GDP_c)", there is still residual variability left after accounting for it. After removing the linear relationships between the potential confounder and both the explanatory and the outcome, the residual plot shows there is still a linear relationship between tariff rates and regime type.

The *bestATE* is the estimaor in a *lm* function with all the relevant covariates in the model. The *unbiasedATE* is the estimaor in a *lm* function with no covariates in the model at all. The *bestATE2* is the estimator in a residual-based function.  

To assess biasedness, I compare sample means of the estimators with the true mean I created in the simulation test. Simply, I can compare the third row, the values of bias for each estimator, and choose the smallest one (bias is denoted as the absolute positive values: the differences between trueATE and the means of the estimates). All of the three estimators are close to the true mean (`r trueATE`) I created in the simulation test. This suggests all three of them are (pretty much) unbiased. In fact, the *bestATE* has the lowest bias out of the three. Its absolute distance to the true mean is the smallest one, with bias equals to `r bias[1]`. The *bestATE2* is slightly biased (with biase equalling to `r bias[3]`).  


Mean Squared Error (MSE) is the mean of the squared differences between the estimated value and the true value. It combines bias and efficiency to measure the closedness of the estimator to the ture parameter. To assess efficiency, the MSEs for bestATE and bestATE2 are relatively the same, but the bestATE2 behave slightly better (`r MSE[3]` < `r MSE[1]`). The three estimators *bestATE*, *unbiasedATE* and *bestATE2* are all efficient and consistent, suggesting that these three estimate are very converging to the true mean with relatively low variance. From this simulation test, because the *bestATE2* has the lowest MSE, this estimate is preferred.  


#Section III Statistical Inference and Assessment II

In this section, I present the first method of doing statistical inference: permutation: When we have conducted an experiment, and present the readers the treatment effects, we are worried about whether there is a real treatment effect or we get the result by chance. We can surely redo the experiment, but we do not have to. Permutation gives us a way to compute the resampling distribution for test statistics when we assume there is no treatment effect on the outcome of the null hypothesis. If the null hypothesis is true, data after shuffling (the relationships between treatment and outcome are broken) should look like the observed data. P-value gives us information about the probability of getting the observed or more extreme data assuming the null hypothesis is true.


##P-values from the permutation test

P-value tells us how likely I can get the observed treatment effect from my experiment under the no treatment effect null hypothesis. After I have done the hypothetical experiment, I would do a hypothesis testing. Here, in this study, the hypothetical experiment is that countries are "randomly assigned" to be democratic or non-democratic on average over the 1980s and 1990s. The worrisome is the Fisher's sharp null hypothesis: there is a possibility of no effect for all the units in this hypothetical experiment. Instead, I just observe the differences in means by chance. My null hypothesis is there is no treatment effect between the treated and control groups for each unit. In other words, the null hypothesis is there are no differences in the tariff rates between democratic and non-democratic countries.

p_lmcan <- summary(OLS_5_5Bs)$coef[2,4] 

```

First, I use a test statistic to summarize my observed data from the experiment: `r simlmtest_lm5Bs` is my test statistic of mean difference in tariff rates. Second, I set the null hypothesis of no effects: I create a new experiment and shuffle the labels of countries. Here, I break the relatioships existing in the data structure to create an experiment of no effect. Then, by using the computing power, I replicate the experiments of no effect in the testing on the computer as if I run the experiments 10000 times. Then I observe the differences-in-means `r mean(expBeta_lm5Bs)` under the null hypotehsis, and we compare how likely it is to get the differences-in-means greater than or equal to the observed data. This probability is the p-value `r pvalue_lm_ts`. It means we have `r (pvalue_lm_ts)` (around 1 in 5 replications of the no effect experiment) to produce the values as large as or greater than the estimators in the *lm* function. The p-value here is the probability that value as extreme or more extreme will be observed under the null hypothesis. This probability gives me the information that I may not have much evidence to against the null effect hypothesis, which is the difference between the observed treatment effect and the effect under the null hypothesis is not due to chance.


I use the permutation test to obtain the p-value where the test statistic is calculated based on the data itself under the null hypothesis. The key advantage of this test does not rely on any assumptions of the distribution. In the canned lm function, the standard assumption that the statistic follows a t-distribution gives a p-value of `r default_p`  (by default). This is in quite good agreement with the p-value I obtained in the permutation test `r pvalue_lm_ts`. But I would not necessarily know beforehand that the two p-values would agree. The following figure shows the null distribution obtained from using the data itself is close to a t-distribution. This can explain why the p-value from the CLT+IID justified test and the p-value from the permutation test is similar.

```

After I calculated the p-value `r pvalue_lm_ts` from a permutation test, I replicated this process for 50 times and calculated 50 different p-values generated from the same process. From this histogram, we can see that the p-values are distributed around from 0.22 to 0.26.

falsepos_lm5Bs

```

To check the error rate of the *lm function*, I create a null effect in the error rate test knowing that my null hypothesis is true. If the falsely positive rate is 0.05, this means in 5 out of 100 times, the test faslely rejects the nulls (knowing the null is true but I still reject it). If the false positive rate is close to 0.05, it means the test fulfils its promises. The false positive rate is `r falsepos_lm5Bs`. If we run it a couple of times, the false positive rates are slightly different, but they are around 0.05. The p-value from the built-in lm function has a similar false positive rate to the nominal false positive rate (0.05).

In this plot, we know that when there is no true effect, p-values are what is called 'uniformly distributed under the null'. The p-value distribution is basically flat. Every p-value is equally likely when the null hypothesis is true, and every bar in the graph will contain 5% of all the p-values (as indicated by the dotted red line). The first bar is the false positive rate, which is slightly higher than but it is very close to 0.05.

##Power and effect size

When my study has effects, I hope that the test has the power to detect the true effect when the null hypothesis is false. Increasing the power of the test requires bigger sample sizes, or studying larger effects. Here, my sample size is 81, and I want to check which test (of *lm* or *lmrob*) has higher power for different effect sizes.

I can use simulations to estimate the statistical power of a model. The statistical power is the probability of observing a statistically significant result, if there is a true effect. When there is an effect, I hope that my statistical test is able to detect it. This denotes to high power in my study.   

Cohen describes effect size as the degree to which the null hypothesis is false. In this simulation test, I generate different hypothetical effect sizes (from 0.1 to 5), and I calculate the number of p-values that are lower than 0.05 ("reject the null") when I know there is a true effect (the null is false). When the effect size increases, the powers in both functions also increase. 


For a given sample size, the *lmrob* model has larger statistical power given an effect size. As effect size increases, the power of the *lmrob* model is also increasing faster than that of the *lm* model. To achieve an ideal 80% statistical power, the *lmrob* model requires an effect size larger than 5. 80% statistical power essentially means when there is a true effect, there is 80 percent that I will observe a significant effect. For this *lm* model, I need a bigger effect size to achieve the same level of power as *lmrob* model requires. The tests may have lower power so I may not be able to identify a significant result where there is a real effect.


##Permutation Confidence Invertals


In the previous section, I have obtained the p-value by repeatedly calculating the test statistic from a large number of permutations of the data. On its surface, the permutation confidence interval in this section is simply the set of all values of the parameter for which the null hypothesis is not rejected. To obtain a confidence interval, I tried to use some p-values to test a numer of different hypotheses to create a collection of non-rejected hypotheses. This is how we calculate the confidence interval from the permutation tests.   


My null hypotheses in this hypothesis testing are addictive treatment effects. I used two methods to calculate the confidence intervals: one with the *uniroot* function to find two tails of confidence limits where the p-value from the *lm* or *lmrob* function of the certain hypothesis is less than 5%, which is the conventional benchmark of leading to the rejection of that hypothesis. The confidence interval calculated from this method agrees with the default confidence interval in the *lm* function. The assumption of this method is a central limit theorem (CLT) and independent identically distributed random samples (iid).
  
  
  
The second test sets the significance level 0.05, and specify the confidence coefficient 0.95 to reflect the true coverage probability. I created null hypotheses as a constant addictive effect and compute an interval estimate where the right and left end points' p values are approximately equal to 0.05. Within the two-sided confidence intervals, the estimates' p-values are larger than 0.05. I show part of the procedure in this method in table "Searching for non-rejected intervals under permutation for *lm* and *lmrob* models."


 
From the table we can see this second method (see the results in the "permuted lm confidence interval" and "permuted *lmrob* confidence interval") produces confidence intervals that do not accord with the first method. At this moment, I cannot figure out why the confidence intervals in the second method have no overlap with the ones in the first method.

#Statistical Inference and Assessment Strategies II

When I have a relatively large sample (N=81), the central limit theory and asymptotic theory can help me not to actually conduct a permutation test to do the hypothesis testing. This hypothetical experimental pool is fairly large. When we have a large sample size of observation, we know as the sample size increases, the samples means will follow an approximately normal distribution. A second method that works well in my dataset is to use mathematical formulas for standard errors that relax the IID assumption and resist highly influential points in a variety of ways (like the "HC" standard errors and the "Robust Cluster" standard errors). What matters is to correct the OLS standard errors. In this section, I will use a simple univariate regression model to demonstrate the process of using a variety of ways to calculate the robust standard errors from the *lm* model.    


In my dataset, I worry about the assumption of IID because I suspect the random variables are not independent and identically distributed because I do not know how the observational data are generated. There is an a priori reason to suspect that there is heteroscedasticity in my data, given that this problem is common in cross-sectional data. Heteroscedasticity occurs when the variance of the errors varies across observations (Long & Ervin, 2000, p. 217). In simple words, when the variance of errors is not constant, one of the important assumptions of a linear model, homoscedasticity is violated. In the presence of heteroscedasticity, ordinary least squares estimates are still consistent, but the tests of significance are generally inappropriate because the standard errors obtained from the classic variance covariance matrix are no longer consistent. We will then perform an invalid statistical inference if we do not correct for the possible presence of heteroskedasticity. Figure 2 reveals that we might have a heteroskedasticity problem.


```{r, eval=T, echo=F, results="hide", warning=F} 

OLS_5_5Bs <- lm(Tariff_c ~ Regime_Bi_c + log(GDP_c) + EC_c + WTO_c, data=mydata_5)

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data=NULL, aes(OLS_5_5Bs$fitted.values, OLS_5_5Bs$residuals^2))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0)+
  theme_classic()+
  xlab("fitted values")+
  ylab("squared residuals")

```



I simplify my regression without controlling for covariates as the following at this moment:
$Tariff_{i,t} = \beta_0 + \beta_1*Democarcy_{i,t-1} + \varepsilon_i$. The standard errors drawn from the OLS canned function will be biased if there is a presence of heteroskedasticity of unknown form in my dataset. Note that the assumption the variance of the error term for each x is constant (Homoskedasticity) is not necessary to show that OLS estimators are unbiased. Heteroscedasticity occurs when the variance of the errors varies across observations (Long & Ervin, 2000, p.217). In simple words, when the variance of errors is not constant, one of the important assumptions of a linear model, homoscedasticity is violated. In the presence of heteroscedasticity, ordinary least squares estimates are still consistent, but the tests of significance are generally inappropriate because the standard errors obtained from the classic variance covariance matrix are no longer consistent. We will then perform an invalid statistical inference if we do not correct for the possible presence of heteroskedasticity. Figure 2 reveals that we might have a heteroskedasticity problem.


Here, I use a avariety of approaches to correct OLS standard errors, by hands and by using packages. The table shows that the results are similar.


To apply the heteroskedasticity consistent covariance matrix (HCCME), I simplify my regression without controlling for covariates as the following at this moment:
$tradepolicy_{i,t} = \beta_0 + \beta_1*DEMOCRACY_{i,t-1} + \varepsilon_i$. 


I calculated the unclusterd HC0, HC1, HC2, and HC3 robust standard errors by heteroskedasticity consistent covariance matrix (HCCME) (also known as White robust errors) and by using a "sandwich" R-statistic package. The results are the same, so I know the results computed by the programming packages are reliable in a more complicated model. According to (Long & Ervin, 2000), HC0 is the most commonly used, but HC3-based test is more reliable when the sample size is smaller than 250. I also use the "wild bootstrap" simulation method to cross-check the results. The "HC" standard errors taking into account the Heteroscedasticity in fact smaller than the default standard errors from the OLS.   


The clustered versions of standard errors from different methods are also very close to the unclustered versions. After controlling for clustering, I note that the using different methods including covariance matrix and wild bootstrap, the clustered standard errors and unclustered standard errors turn out to be very similar. It is possibly due to the fact that I have collapsed the data in different periods for the given countries, so that the correlated model errors in different time periods within the country level have been removed. In other words, the variances over time within-country are no longer present in the dataset. The number of clustering at the country level may still exist, but the standard errors controlling for the unknown form of cluster error correlation do not deviate much from the unclusterd robust standard errors. The previous tables show the comparions of the standard errors calculted by different methods.

I plotted the confidence intervals computed by the clustered robust standard errors in the complete *lm* model with covariates. I assume the standard errors obtained from the clustered function I wrote are accurate because they have corrected for the possible problems of clustering on the state level and the heteroskedasty in the data structure. I also verified the results from the clustered function are not misleading because they tend to agree with the other methods. Because I do not know the structure of heteroskedasticity, it is safe to
use the clustered robust standard errors. I also compute the confidence interval with the White HC3 and the clustered standard errors. They are the same (results are not shown).  



In the first plot entitled "Confidence Intervals with Robust Standard Errors (lm)", we can see the confidence interval for the targeted estimator includes zero. It means that I cannot reject the null hypothesis that the treatment effect (the effects of democracies on tariff rates) equals to zero. In addition, although the confidence intervals of log(GDP) and economic crisis do not include zero, they are pretty close to it. Also, the robust standard error for economic crisis is quite large, and hence the confidence interval is wide, which suggests the certainty of this estimate is also large.    


The second plot shows the confidence intervals calculated from the default *lmrobust* function. For all the estimators, the confidence intervals are very close to zero. I cannot reject the possibility that there is no treatment effect. Democratic developing countries on average over time may not have lower tariff rates than non-democratic developing countries.

##Coverage Probability of the Confidence Interval


I also use a simulation method for estimating the coverage probability of the confidence interval calculated from the robust standard error I calculated. Because I have a relatively large sample, I compute the 95% confidence interval as an asymptotic one: $\hat\beta plus or minus 1.96*se$. After I obtained the confidence interval, I need to check its coverage probability. 


Here I explain how I proceed to calculate the coverage probability of the confidence interval. Under simulation, I had 1000 samples drawn from the same population (of a sample size from original dataset without replacement). I then use the standard error to compute the confidence interval for each sample. I then computed the proportion of samples for which the *true* mean of the 'population' fall into the confidence interval in each of the 1000 iterations. In such a large repeated sample, I want to check if the confidence intervals include the true population parameter 95 percent of the time. 


Unfortunately, the confidence interval fails to meet its desired object. 100% of the estimated confidence intervals contain the true population mean. This confidence interval is too wide, including the True parameter more than it should. I will risk accepting a null hypothesis when it is false. In other words, my hypothesis testing is underpowered: I may fail to reject a null hypothesis when it is false. 


It suggests my standard errors are not accurate, or my hypothesis testing fails to achieve its purpose. Or, this result may suggest that my method of calculating the coverage probability is not correct.
